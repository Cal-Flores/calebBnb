This is the home page of CalebBnB that renders automatically upon loading up the app. The homepage queries the database to give you the most up to date housing information on CalebBnb. Select "Become a host" to post your very own home to CalebBnB (must be logged in)!

This is the details page that renders when you select on a home. You can see additional information and navigate to the reviews of this spot in this page. If you are the owner of this spot, you can delete or edit your spot from the spot details page! If you are not the owner the edit and delete options will not render.

This is the Reviews Page to get a look at other CalebBnBs users thoughts on the spot! The stars on the spot are the average of the review stars each commentor is required to give. You can only leave 1 review per spot, then the option to leave a review is replaced with the option to delete the review you have created.
